//Public is a special folder in Next js
//Whateveris storedin there typicallyimages or funds etc is then served statically by next js.
//Which means you can reference it in your CSS code or in your HTML code. You can easily
//Include images stored in the public folder, because next js will make sure to serve any contents that
//is stored in the public folder aspart of your overall application.
//So it will statically serve any content in there, it makes the content in there available
//to the visitores of your website
//Note: Files and folders stored outside of /public are NOT made accessable by NextJs - visitores can NOT
//load files from there.
